# Tangible Interfaces Submarine Design Project

![Illustration of a Submarine Cockpit](artwork/submarine-illus.png "Illustration of a Submarine Cockpit")

## Introduction

This Submarine Design Project is part of [Steve Turbek's "Tangible Interfaces" Industrial Design class](https://turbek.com/articles/tangible-interfaces-class.html) at Pratt Institute. In this project, you'll work in teams to create an immersive submarine piloting experience that combines industrial design, user interface design, and physical computing with a custom [Submarine Simulator](https://steveturbek.github.io/Tangible-Interfaces-Submarine-Design-Project).

## The Design Challenge

You are a design team tasked by "AquaNova Submarine" with creating the next generation of personal submersibles for beginner pilots.

Success in this project will require balancing aesthetic appeal with functional clarity. Your instruments must be visually consistent with your cockpit design while providing clear information. Your physical controls must feel natural while providing the precision needed for delicate maneuvers.

You'll work in teams of three/four to cover all the tasks. At the end of the project, visiting guests will test each design to determine which provides the most intuitive user experience, their average time to complete the mission will be a factor in rating the design of the team.

To make this project possible for a design student, a technical framework has been made. The project contains basic recipes to connect hardware controls to this game. Very little electronics or programming is expected. Examples are provided to learn from.

**We want the control experience to be THE major selling point of this sub - what innovative and cool experience can you design?**

### Your mission:

1. Research and identify a **target market**
1. Create the **brand** for your sub
1. Research and **design the vehicle** exterior
1. A **cockpit interior design** prototype, either beautiful or rough, from wood or cardboard, with a pilot position (Seated, Prone, Recumbent, or Standing)
1. An innovative and beautiful **physical controls** (buttons, joysticks, etc.) to drive the submarine with an intuitive piloting experience
1. **Microbit code** to interpret the controls and send to the laptop.
1. Design submersible **dashboard user experience** for the instruments to communicate critical vehicle information
1. Write and Design a **User Start Guide** (Printed, PDF, or interactive)
1. **Test** with real people
1. Write up and present design, process, and findings

### Game Setup

- The [Submarine Simulator](https://steveturbek.github.io/Tangible-Interfaces-Submarine-Design-Project) is a web based game that connects to a Microbit (or other device) via USB cable.
- The game has two windows/monitors: the submarine's front window and an instrument panel. In the final presentation, the instruments are in a laptop window, with a projector for the outside view.
- A Microbit can be programmed to interpret sensor inputs from a custom designed control to steer the submarine.

## Game Overview

### The Gameplay Experience

Your submersible will navigate through an underwater maze of coral reefs. The pilot must reach an underwater base before running out of oxygen or electricity. The gameplay emphasizes careful resource management and precise navigation through challenging 3D environments.

[Submarine Simulator](https://steveturbek.github.io/Tangible-Interfaces-Submarine-Design-Project)

Note the game is intended to be played with custom hardware controls, but can be steered with USB gamepad for development or keyboard (See below for tips).

### Submarine Controls

The student will have the ability to design the submarine. Here are the technical design constraints. A clever team can write code to change these, but they are responsible for these customizations.

- Left (Port) and Right(Starboard) [Underwater thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_thruster) : These face forward and are centered front to back and top to bottom. They operate like tank treads, if both drive forward, the vehicle goes forward; both back: back; one front the other back, vehicle turns. One operating, the other not, the vehicle goes at half speed and turns in the opposite direction.
- [Rudder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudder): turns vehicle left and right, proportional to vehicle speed
- [Elevators](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_(aeronautics)>): points vehicle up and down, proportional to vehicle speed
- Vertical thrusters; Small thrusters that point vehicle up and down; very slow, but works when not in motion

The submarine simulation is an idealized vehicle to keep the project fun!

### 💡 Tips for New Pilots

1. **Start slow**: Begin with small adjustments to get a feel for the submarine's response.
2. **Watch your depth**
3. **Turn gradually**
4. **Monitor your systems**:

### Game Mechanics

- Oxygen management (countdown timer)
- Electric power management (reduced by engine usage)
- Navigation challenges (tight passageways, 3D maze)

### Cockpit Instruments

Students will design and implement SVG-based instruments displaying:

- Oxygen level 0-100%
- Battery level 0-100%
- Speed
- Pitch (up / down)
- Yaw (left/right)
- Sonar distance to target
- Depth
- Compass direction 0-359°

### Physical Controls

Using the Micro:bit v2 as a bridge to the computer, students will implement at a minimum:

- Game start/selection controls
- "Blow tanks" emergency button
- Forward/backward propulsion (digital and analog)
- Pitch and yaw steering (digital and analog)

## Getting Started

### Technical Requirements

- **Computer**: Mac Laptop (others may work as well)
- **Browser**: Chrome (latest version)
- **Hardware**: Micro:bit v2 for physical controls configuration, connected to Mac with USB
- **UX design**: Figma (recommended), Adobe Illustrator, AI tools for coding
- **Programming**: Basic HTML and CSS (examples provided)

<!--
### Installation
<!--### Local Development Setup

**IMPORTANT:** When developing locally, you must use a local web server due to browser security restrictions. Opening HTML files directly (via `file://`) will prevent the instruments from working.

**Option 1: Python (Recommended for macOS, should not need installation)**

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/Tangible-Interfaces-Submarine-Design-Project

# Start the server (Python 3 comes pre-installed on macOS)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Open in Chrome
# http://localhost:8080
```


**Option 2: VS Code Live Server Extension**

1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

**Option 3: Node.js**

```bash
# Install http-server globally (if you have Node.js)
npm install -g http-server

# Run the server
http-server -p 8080
``` -->

### Development Workflow

#### Physical Controls

1. What is your concept of control? What are the physical motions a pilot could use? Which parts of their body.
1. Choose your sensors - joystick components are the least interesting choice. Take inspiration from planes, vehicles, Sci-Fi movies..
1. Rig up a prototype & TEST it with friends
1. Program a microbit to send the output to the game via serial over USB. Use [this sample code](microbit/thunderstick-serial-demo.microbitJavascript) to start from. [Makecode link](https://makecode.microbit.org/S99508-25130-71089-08675)
1. Refine prototype to a looks-like/works-like unit & TEST it with friends
1. Final CAD / Product manufacture

**Note**

- A Makecode editor open in a browser tab at the same time as the game may have worse performance as each tab is 'taking' the serial messages from the microbit.

#### Instruments

1. Modify the SVG instrument files in `instruments/` folder
1. Test your implementation using keyboard controls or USB gamepad
1. Build physical controls using sensors from class kit
1. Program Micro:bit to interpret the sensors, use the provided example file `microbit/thunderstick-serial-demo.microbitJavascript`
1. Upload to Google drive to collaborate with your partners
1. At the end, upload the project to github as a 'fork' (help will be provided)

**Students should:**

- use HTML and CSS to design the instruments window
- Design the instrument files using Figma or Illustrator
- Use AI to modify the instrument logic, for example changing line chart to a dial chart
- **If instruments are not updating, do 'hard reload' ( Cmd + Shift + R on a Mac) **
- Note it is possible to use an iPad/iPhone for touchscreen controls using [Duet display](https://www.duetdisplay.com/)
