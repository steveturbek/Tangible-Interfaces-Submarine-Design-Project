# Tangible Interfaces Submarine Design Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Submarine Design Project for Steve Turbek's "Tangible Interfaces" Industrial Design class at Pratt Institute! This collaborative challenge sits at the intersection of industrial design, user experience, and physical computing. Throughout this project, you'll work in teams to create an immersive submarine piloting experience that combines digital interfaces with physical controls.

## The Design Challenge

You are a design team tasked by "AquaNova Submarine" with creating the next generation of personal submersibles. Your submersible needs to navigate complex underwater environments while providing an intuitive interface for pilots of varying experience levels.

Success in this project will require balancing aesthetic appeal with functional clarity. Your instruments must be visually consistent with your cockpit design while providing clear information. Your physical controls must feel natural while providing the precision needed for delicate maneuvers.

You'll work in teams of three. Two teams will design seated cockpits and two teams will design prone (laying down) cockpits . At the end of the project, visiting guests will test each design to determine which provides the most intuitive user experience, their average time to complete the mission will be a factor in rating the design of the team.

Your mission:

1. Research and identify target market
1. Create brand for sub line
1. Design the visual styling of your submersible cockpit
1. Create on-screen digital user experience instruments that effectively communicate critical vehicle information
1. Build physical control set (buttons, joysticks, etc.) to drive the submarine that provide an intuitive piloting experience
1. User Start Guide as needed
1. Test with real people
1. Write up and present design, process, and findings

**Are you ready to dive in?**

## The Gameplay Experience

Your submersible will navigate through an underwater maze of coral reefs. The pilot must reach an underwater base before running out of oxygen or electricity. The gameplay emphasizes careful resource management and precise navigation through challenging 3D environments.

Note the game is intended to be played with custom hardware controls, but can be steered with keyboard for development. See below for tips.

## Physical Prototype

To make this project possible for a design student, we have a technical framework to build from. This GitHub Project builds a web app 'game' with on-screen UX instruments that can be customized. The project contains simplish recipes to connect hardware controls to this game. Very little electronics or programming is expected. Examples are provided to learn from.

The student will design and fabricate th items in diagram below

1. A cockpit design prototype (orange), either beautiful or rough, from wood or cardboard
1. An innovative and beautiful physical control set (red/green)
1. The controls will send signals to the Micro:bit board (center)
1. The board will send a USB message to the student laptop (blue)
1. The laptop drive an external monitor(s) embedded in cockpit design prototype (blue rectangle)

## Submarine Description

The student will have the ability to design the submarine. Here are the technical design constraints. A clever team can write code to change these, but they are responsible for these customizations.

- Left (Port) and Right(Starboard) [Underwater thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_thruster) : These face forward and are centered front to back and top to bottom. They operate like tank treads, if both drive forward, the vehicle goes forward; both back: back; one front the other back, vehicle turns. One operating, the other not, the vehicle goes at half speed and turns in the opposite direction.
- [Rudder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudder): turns vehicle left and right, proportional to vehicle speed
- [Elevators](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_(aeronautics)>): points vehicle up and down, proportional to vehicle speed
- Aft thrusters; Small thrusters that point vehicle up and down; very slow, but works when not in motion

The submarine is an idealized, simplified vehicle to keep the project fun!

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Apply industrial design principles to vehicle interface design
- Translate abstract data into meaningful visual instruments
- Create physical control systems that map intuitively to digital actions
- Test and iterate based on user feedback
- Collaborate effectively with a design team
- Present and defend design decisions

## Game Overview

### Current State

The game is functional, can be navigated with keyboard keys or with a microbit. See Github Issues for ideas.

### Submarine Control Guide - Left Hand Keyboard Layout

Note the game is intended to be played with custom hardware controls, but can be steered with keyboard for development.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Left Hand üïπÔ∏è Key Controls

| Key     | Function               | Effect                                                      |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `W`     | Elevator Up            | Pitches the submarine downward (descend)                    |
| `S`     | Elevator Down          | Pitches the submarine upward (ascend)                       |
| `A`     | Rudder Left            | Turns the submarine to the left                             |
| `D`     | Rudder Right           | Turns the submarine to the right                            |
| `Q`     | Left Thruster Increase | Increases power to the left thruster                        |
| `Z`     | Left Thruster Decrease | Decreases power to the left thruster                        |
| `E`     | Left Thruster Increase | Increases power to the left thruster                        |
| `C`     | Left Thruster Decrease | Decreases power to the left thruster                        |
| `` ` `` | Data Console Toggle    | Toggles the submarine data overlay (press the backtick key) |

### üìä Less Common Controls

| Key | Function              | Effect                                     |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `2` | Aft Thruster Increase | Increases power to the aft (rear) thruster |
| `X` | Aft Thruster Decrease | Decreases power to the aft thruster        |
| `B` | Emergency Surface     | Activates emergency surfacing procedure    |

### üí° Tips for New Pilots

1. **Start slow**: Begin with small adjustments to get a feel for the submarine's response.
2. **Watch your depth**: Use `W` and `S` to control your ascent and descent.
3. **Turn gradually**: Gentle adjustments with `A` and `D` will help maintain control.
4. **Monitor your systems**: Toggle the data console with the backtick key (`` ` ``) to view important submarine metrics.
5. **Emergency surface**: If you get into trouble, press `B` to initiate emergency surfacing.
